    "Q.4. Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "The right shift operator (>>) and left shift operator (<<) are bitwise operators in Python. They are used to shift the bits of a binary number to the right or left, respectively. These operators can be used on integers to perform bitwise operations at the binary level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right Shift Operator (>>):\n",
    "The right shift operator shifts the binary representation of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. It effectively divides the number by 2 raised to the power of the specified shift amount, discarding the rightmost bits.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "number = 16  # Binary: 10000\n",
    "shift_amount = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = number >> shift_amount  # Shift right by 2 positions\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 4 (Binary: 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number 16 is represented as 10000 in binary. Shifting it to the right by 2 positions using the right shift operator >> gives us the result 4, which is represented as 100 in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Left Shift Operator (<<):\n",
    "The left shift operator shifts the binary representation of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. It effectively multiplies the number by 2 raised to the power of the specified shift amount, appending zeros on the right.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "number = 3  # Binary: 11\n",
    "shift_amount = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = number << shift_amount  # Shift left by 2 positions\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 12 (Binary: 1100)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number 3 is represented as 11 in binary. Shifting it to the left by 2 positions using the left shift operator << gives us the result 12, which is represented as 1100 in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that shifting beyond the available bits or beyond the limits of the data type may result in unexpected behavior or wrapping around. Additionally, shifting negative numbers with the right shift operator may introduce sign extension, where the sign bit is preserved."
