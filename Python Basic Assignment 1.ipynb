    "Answer - A string is a type of data that represents a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. In programming, strings are typically used to store and manipulate text-based data. In many programming languages, strings are enclosed within quotation marks, such as single quotes ('namaste') or double quotes (\"namaste\").\n",
    "        Basically a variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. They act as containers that can hold different types of data, including strings. Variables can be assigned values, and those values can change during the execution of a program.\n",
    "        In conclusion , a string is a datatype of different charactaristics , letters, variables even including variable while variables can be used to store information strings in our computer system."

    "Q.8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid ?\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, including Python, variable names need to follow certain rules and conventions. Here are a few reasons why 'eggs' is a valid variable name while '100' is considered invalid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with a digit: Variable names typically cannot start with a digit. They should start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore character ('_'). This rule is in place to distinguish variable names from numeric literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consisting only of digits: Variable names should not consist solely of digits. This is because a name made up of only digits may be confused with a numeric value or literal. Variable names are meant to represent identifiers for values or objects, not the values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these rules, 'eggs' is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter and doesn't consist solely of digits. It adheres to the conventions for naming variables. On the other hand, '100' starts with a digit, violating the rule of not beginning with a digit, and it consists only of digits, making it indistinguishable from a numeric literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that some programming languages may have different rules or allow certain exceptions regarding variable naming conventions. However, in most commonly used programming languages, such as Python, the rules mentioned above generally apply."
