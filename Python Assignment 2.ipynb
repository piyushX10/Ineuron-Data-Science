    "\n",
    "Break Statement: The \"break\" statement is used to immediately terminate the innermost loop (such as a \"for\" or \"while\" loop) and resume execution at the next statement following the loop. When encountered, the \"break\" statement exits the loop entirely, regardless of whether the loop's condition is still satisfied. This means that the loop's remaining iterations are skipped, and control is transferred to the next statement after the loop. Here's an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Continue Statement: The \"continue\" statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. When encountered, the \"continue\" statement skips the remaining code within the loop for that iteration and starts the next iteration. This means that the loop continues to execute, but the code following the \"continue\" statement within the current iteration is ignored. Here's an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "range(0, 10): This expression explicitly specifies the start value as 0 and the end value as 10 (exclusive). Since the step value is not provided, it defaults to 1. Therefore, range(0, 10) also generates the sequence of values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The result is the same as range(10).\n",

It produces the same result as the previous two expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) are equivalent expressions that produce the sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. The only difference lies in the explicitness of the start, end, and step values provided in the arguments, but the generated sequence remains the same."
